## Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for LLM-Driven PX4 Drone Control

### 1. Introduction

This report presents the design and implementation plan for a custom Domain-Specific Language (DSL) enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate dynamic, safe, and expressive drone mission plans for PX4 autopilot systems via MAVSDK. The DSL integrates internal sensor data, real-time vision detections, and advanced control commands (movement, rotation, navigation), providing a structured, human-readable, and machine-parseable syntax suitable for research and real-world deployment.

### 2. DSL Design Goals

* **Safety & Robustness**: Constrain available commands, enforce flight limits, and validate syntax to prevent mission-critical failures.
* **Expressiveness**: Support complex control flows: conditionals (`IF/ELSE`), loops (`WHILE`), variable assignments (`SET`), and arithmetic operations.
* **LLM-Friendly**: Simple EBNF grammar with limited vocabulary to ensure consistent generation by LLMs.
* **Machine-Parseable**: Deterministic parsing into MAVSDK Python calls via a lightweight interpreter.

### 3. EBNF Grammar Specification

```ebnf
program            ::= statement*
statement          ::= command | conditional | loop | assignment

command            ::= "ARM"
                     | "DISARM"
                     | "TAKEOFF" altitude_expr
                     | "LAND"
                     | "MOVE" direction number
                     | "TURN" rotation_direction number
                     | "GOTO" coordinate_expr
                     | "HOLD" number
                     | "RETURN_HOME"

conditional        ::= "IF" condition "THEN" statement*
                     ["ELSEIF" condition "THEN" statement*]*
                     ["ELSE" statement*] "ENDIF"

loop               ::= "WHILE" condition "DO" statement* "ENDWHILE"

assignment         ::= "SET" identifier "=" expr

condition          ::= sensor_condition | vision_condition | numeric_condition | composite_condition
sensor_condition   ::= "BATTERY" comparison number
                     | "IN_AIR" comparison boolean
vision_condition   ::= "DETECTED" "(" string ")"
numeric_condition  ::= identifier comparison number
composite_condition::= condition logical_operator condition

direction          ::= "UP" | "DOWN" | "LEFT" | "RIGHT" | "FORWARD" | "BACKWARD"
rotation_direction ::= "CLOCKWISE" | "COUNTERCLOCKWISE"
coordinate_expr    ::= expr "," expr "," expr
expr               ::= identifier | number | arithmetic_expr
arithmetic_expr    ::= expr arithmetic_op expr
comparison         ::= "<" | "<=" | "==" | "!=" | ">=" | ">"
logical_operator   ::= "AND" | "OR"
boolean            ::= "TRUE" | "FALSE"
identifier         ::= variable_name | special_object
special_object     ::= "OBJECT(" string ").X" | "OBJECT(" string ").Y"
                       | "OBJECT(" string ").Z" | "OBJECT(" string ").CONFIDENCE"
                       | "BATTERY" | "ALTITUDE" | "LATITUDE" | "LONGITUDE"
                       | "PEOPLE_COUNT"
```

### 4. Example Mission Plans

**Survey Grid Pattern**

```dsl
SET grid_alt = 5
ARM
TAKEOFF grid_alt
WHILE BATTERY >= 30 DO
    MOVE FORWARD 10
    TURN CLOCKWISE 90
ENDWHILE
RETURN_HOME
LAND
```

**Dynamic People Counting**

```dsl
ARM
TAKEOFF 5
IF DETECTED("person") THEN
    SET PEOPLE_COUNT = OBJECT("person").COUNT
    IF PEOPLE_COUNT > 2 THEN
        MOVE FORWARD 3
        HOLD 5
    ELSE
        RETURN_HOME
    ENDIF
ELSE
    RETURN_HOME
ENDIF
LAND
```

### 5. Parsing & Execution Pipeline

1. **Data Acquisition**: Collect JSON-formatted sensor (`battery`, `in_air`) and vision data (`YOLO`Â detentions).
2. **Prompt Construction**: Feed LLM with mission objective, sensor snapshot, and DSL syntax examples.
3. **DSL Generation**: LLM outputs script following the EBNF grammar.
4. **DSL Interpreter**: Python module parses the DSL, enforces safety (altitude limits, geofence), and translates commands into asynchronous MAVSDK calls.
5. **Execution**: Run the generated MAVSDK code on the PX4 drone via `asyncio`, with real-time telemetry monitoring.

### 6. Future Work & Research Directions

* **Extended Control Structures**: Add support for functions/macros, event-driven triggers, and timers.
* **Formal Verification**: Integrate model checking to verify mission scripts against safety invariants.
* **LLM Fine-Tuning**: Train or fine-tune models on DSL examples to improve generation consistency.
* **Multi-Drone Coordination**: Expand DSL to include swarm commands and inter-drone communication primitives.
* **Adaptive Learning**: Implement feedback loops where mission outcomes refine LLM prompt templates and DSL grammar.

### 7. Conclusion

This DSL-driven approach empowers LLMs to generate reliable, dynamic mission scripts for PX4 drones, balancing safety, flexibility, and ease of use. The clear grammar, robust interpreter, and future enhancements position this framework as a significant contribution to autonomous UAV research.
